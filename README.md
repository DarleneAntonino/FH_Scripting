### Description
> What will we do
We are planning to read an inputfile and compare it to a (existing?) database of quotes. If the inputfile matched one of the quotes, you will recive an email with this quote to an email address of your choice.


This "project" contains/will implement/focus on:
* Access to Files
* Access to Database (if we build it our own)
* Regex
* External Data Sources (if we use an already existing database)
* User Interaction and Configuration
